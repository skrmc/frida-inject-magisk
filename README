To compile agent/src/index.ts into JS and package it along
with frida-inject into a Magisk module, simply run:

FRIDA_VERSION=x.y.z PKG=com.example.app scripts/module.sh

in the repository root directory. The content of index.ts
is merely a placeholder; please write it according to your
actual debugging needs.
